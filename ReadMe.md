## Internship Overview

This section provides a brief introduction to the purpose of this repository and the overall goal of your internship portfolio.

In pursuit of my degree, I completed a series of internships in various organizations. These internships allowed me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world scenarios, collaborate with professionals, and gain valuable industry experience. This repository aims to showcase my growth and development throughout these internships.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized using the following folder structure:

```
├── Internship 1
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── Code/
│   ├── Documentation/
│   ├── Screenshots/
│   └── ...
├── Internship 2
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── Code/
│   ├── Documentation/
│   ├── Screenshots/
│   └── ...
├── Internship 3
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── Code/
│   ├── Documentation/
│   ├── Screenshots/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Each internship is represented by a separate folder. Inside each internship folder, you'll find a README.md file to provide an overview of that specific internship, along with directories for code, documentation, screenshots, and any other relevant files.
